#About

My current project for a big client used [ng-lightning](https://github.com/ng-lightning/ng-lightning) and was therefore dependent on rxjs-compat for updates to Angular >= 6. 

My employer [leanovate](https://github.com/leanovate) enables developers to use up to 20% of his/her time for learning. So I decided to migrate ng-lightning to ng6...     

This started as a fork with the goal of a PR with all changes needed. 
But it seems, the original project does not get that much attention from the original contributers anylonger. This is not meant as blaming or something like that! 
Just my experience from getting no response on gitter and from looking at the responses in the issues section.

That is why this new repository exists.
